# Selection-Algorithms
We discussed three ways to compute the median in Algorithms and Analysis course. The first task of this assignment is to compare their performance. The three methods are:
The randomized divide-and-conquer approach [CLRS 9.2].
The deterministic linear-time selection algorithm using median-of-medians [CLRS 9.3].
The naive method using sorting and returning the k-th smallest number.
Implement the first two methods only. You can use native sorting for the last one.
Make sure that the returned results of your implementations are correct before doing the analysis to avoid repeating your work unnecessarily.
Study the performance of your implementations as the size of the input array grows (up to 107 elements). The arrays you use for the analysis should be randomly generated. For each data point, you should compute the average of multiple runs.
